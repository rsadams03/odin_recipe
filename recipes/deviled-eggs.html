    <h1>Mustardy Deviled Eggs From Wursthall</h1>

    <h2>What are the elements of a great deviled egg?</h2>
    <p>I like to think of deviled eggs as a suit. The egg white and filling are like the jacket and pants—they're the main attraction, and the part that the egg is largely going to be judged by. The other garnishes are like the tie and cufflinks—they've got to fit the ensemble, but you'd better still look good even without them.</p>
    <p>In this case, the basic filling starts out as a slight variation on my favorite deviled eggs. The real secret here is to absolutely pack them with mustard and vinegar. A big dollop of Dijon mustard, a heavy glug of white wine vinegar, and a splash of brine from the pickled Fresno chiles that we make will do the trick. At home, you can use a dash of vinegary hot sauce, or some brine from a jar of pickled hot cherry peppers, in place of the pickled Fresno chile liquid. It won't make much difference.</p>
    <p>When an order comes in, the garde-manger (tonight, that's Rosa) drops a couple small dollops of filling onto a plate to keep the split egg whites in place, pipes in the filling, then starts adding the garnish. A year ago, I coached Rosa through her first time ever using a piping bag. These days, she can pipe circles around me.</p>
    <p>First up: pickled mustard seeds. These are based on a technique I learned from my old boss Ken Oringer in Boston. By cooking down yellow mustard seeds slowly in seasoned vinegar, you can tame their intense heat (mustard heat is neutralized by acid, which is why the hottest styles of mustard are made with water as opposed to vinegar) while simultaneously plumping up the seeds.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the mucilage (real word, look it up!) secreted by the mustard seeds binds the plumped seeds into a sort of gel-like matrix. The result is a condiment that is quite similar in appearance and texture to caviar. The flavor is mildly hot, sweet, and vinegary.</p>
    <p>The only complication is that some—but not all!—mustard seeds contain lots of bitter tannins, which can turn your finished mixture... bitter. What's more, that bitterness can vary a lot by supplier and batch. At the restaurants, we've found mustard seed supplies that have minimal bitterness, but at home I'd strongly suggest boiling the seeds in water a few times in order to remove the bitterness before you finish them in the brine.</p>
    <p>We make these pickled mustard seeds by the gallon. They last virtually forever under refrigeration and make a wonderful garnish for all kinds of dishes. In the past, we've used them to top bone marrow, to brighten up potato and sauerkraut soup, and as part of a glaze for pulled-pork sandwiches.</p>
    <p>After the mustard seeds, Rosa squirts on a bit of extra-virgin olive oil. Not a common addition to deviled eggs, but Ana Sortun douses her amazing deviled eggs with it at Oleana in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and if it's got her blessing, that's all the go-ahead I need.</p>
    <p>Finally, deviled eggs wouldn't be deviled without a source of heat. Mild paprika is just that: mild. I much prefer the brightness and more pronounced heat of Aleppo chile flakes, though we've also experimented with Korean gochugaru. Flaky Maldon sea salt adds crunch and saltiness (salt is just as important for flavor as it is for extra beer sales), and a teeny-tiny sprig of fresh dill (chives or parsley would also work, if you're dill-averse) adds a finishing pop of color and herbal flavor. We keep our dill stored on the stem in chilled water, and pick each frond to order.</p>
    <p>It took quite a few experiments to get to this point—a deviled egg that's not just delicious but fits the theme and style of the restaurant—but, in all honesty, the hardest part was coming up with the name and description on the menu. My partner Adam and I spent several late nights toying with variations. How do you explain that these are basically just deviled eggs, but with more flavor than you're used to in deviled eggs?</p>
    <p>For a while, they were "Really Good Deviled Eggs." Sounds good, right? But some folks weren't expecting the massive hit of mustard they come with. In the end, we settled for plain old "Deviled Eggs," along with "lots of mustard" in the description. That's stuck around for over a year now, and I can't imagine that these will ever come off the menu. They're just that good.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><strong>For the Eggs and Filling:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 large eggs, not too fresh (see note)</li>
		<li>45g (about 3 tablespoons) mayonnaise, preferably homemade</li>
		<li>45g (about 3 tablespoons) Dijon mustard</li>
		<li>45g (about 3 tablespoons) liquid from a jar of pickled cherry peppers (see note)</li>
		<li>20g (about 1 tablespoon) white wine vinegar</li>
		<li>60g (about 4 tablespoons) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
		<li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>To Finish:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pickled mustard seeds</li>
		<li>Aleppo or Korean chile flakes (gochugaru); see note</li>
		<li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
		<li>Crunchy sea salt, such as Maldon</li>
		<li>Fresh dill fronds (chives, parsley, etc)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>STEPS</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>For the Eggs and Filling: Fill a large pot with 1 inch of water. Place steamer insert inside, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add eggs to steamer basket, cover, and continue cooking over high heat for 12 minutes. Meanwhile, add 1 tray of ice cubes to a large bowl and fill with water. Remove eggs and immediately place in bowl of ice water and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before peeling under cool running water. Slice each egg in half lengthwise.</li>
        <li>Place all yolks in the bowl of a food processor. Select 16 of the best-looking egg white halves, rinse in cold water to clean out any excess yolk, and set aside; reserve remaining 8 whites for another use. Add mayonnaise, mustard, cherry pepper liquid, and vinegar to food processor and process until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary.</li>
        <li>With the machine running, slowly drizzle in olive oil in a thin, steady stream. Season mixture to taste with salt. Transfer to a zipper-lock bag or a piping bag fitted with a piping tip. Filling and egg white halves can be stored in the refrigerator up to overnight before eggs are filled and served.</li>
        <li>To Finish: If using a zipper-lock bag to pipe, cut off a corner of the bag. Pipe filling mixture into egg white halves, overstuffing each one. Top with pickled mustard seeds, a squirt of olive oil, chile flakes, sea salt, and dill fronds. Serve immediately.</li>
